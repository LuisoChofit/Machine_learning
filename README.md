# Machine_learning
Some projects about training models of machine learning.

The "Introduction to ML" folder contains my first project in ML where I try to find the best model to predict a categoric variable and using simple metrics to evaluate the model.

In the second folder, I train some models for a similar purpose but taking account other issues like class unbalance and evaluating those models with other kind of metrics.
